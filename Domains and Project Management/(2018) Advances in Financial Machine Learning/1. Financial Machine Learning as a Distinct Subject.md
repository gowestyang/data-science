# 1.1 Motivation
* To cross the proverbial divide that separates academia and the industry: neither extremely elegant mathematics, nor explanations without rigorous academic theory
* Finance serves a purpose: investing will not mean gambling
* Grasp the complexity of ML applications to investments: how to use machine learning correctly

<br>

# 1.2 Why Financial Machine Learning Projects Usually Fail
## 1.2.1 The Sisyphus Paradigm
* Discretionary portfolio managers (PMs) cannot naturally work as a team
    * Each telling a story for every decision, obsessed about one particular piece of information, without fact-based, empirical evidence
* Quants search for false investment opportunities
    * False postivies which overfits backtest
    * Standard factor investing - an overcorwded strategy with a low Sharpe ratio

<br>

## 1.2.2 The Meta-Strategy Paradigm
* Set up a **research factory**, wic various stations of the "assembly line"
* Each individual is to specialize in a particular task, whth a holistic view of the entire process

<br>

# 1.3 Book Structure
## 1.3.1 Structure by Production Chain
Nowadays, the only true alpha left is **microscopic**, but it is much more abundant than macroscopic alpha has ever been.

<br>

### 1.3.1.1 Data Curators
Collect, clean, index, store, adjust, deliver all data
* Experts in market microstrucutre and data protocols

<br>

### 1.3.1.2 Feature Analysts
Transform raw data into informative signals
* Experts in information theory, signal extraction/processing, visualization, labeling, weighting, classifiers, feature importance
* A common error is to believe that feature analysts develop strategies

<br>

### 1.3.1.3 Strategiests
Transform features into actual investment algorithms
* Experiments designed to test the validity of the theory formulated to explain the observations
* A white box with economic mechanism identified

<br>

### 1.3.1.4 Backtesters
Assess the profitability of an investment strategy under various scenarios
* The historical path, as well as alternative scenarios to test weaknesses and strengths of a proposed strategy
* Evaluate the probability of backtest overfitting
* Build prototype with code utilizes the full algorithm

<br>

### 1.3.1.5 Deployment Team
Integrate the strategy code into the production line.
* Algorithm specialists and hardcore mathematical programmers
* Deploy solution that is logically identical to the prototype and optimize the implementation sufficiently

<br>

### 1.3.1.6 Protfolio Oversight
* Embargo: monitor performance over a period reserved by the backtester, or a result of implementation delays
* Paper trading: run the strategy on a live feed to gather enough evidence whether the strategy performs as expected
* Graduation: the strategy manages a real position
    * Evaluate performance precisely, including attributed risk, returns, costs
* Re-allocation: adjust allocation among graduated strategies
* Decommission: perform below expectations - the supporting theory is no longer backed by empirical evidence

<br>

## 1.3.2 Structure by Strategy Component
* Data
* Software
* Hardware
* Math
* Meta-Strategies: the money is not in making a car, but a car factory
* Overfitting: standard cross-validation methods fail in finance; most discoveries in finance are false
    * Be skeptical about your own work
    * Overfitting is unethical
    * A waste of time, resources and opportunities

<br>

## 1.3.3 Structure by Common Pitfall
*Epistemological
    * The Sisyphus paradigm
    * Research through backtesting
* Data processing
    * Chronological sampling
    * Integer differentiation
* Classification
    * Fixed-time horizon labeling
    * Learning side and size simultaneously
    * Weighting of non-IID samples
* Evaluation
    * Cross-validation leakage
    * Walk-forward (historical) backtesting
    * Backtest overfitting

<br>

# 1.4 Target Audience
* Investment professionals with a strong ML background
* Data scientiests who have implemented ML algorithms in fields outside finance

<br>

# 1.5. Requesities
* Practical knowledge of ML, market microstructure, portfolio management, mathematcial finance, etc

<br>

# 1.6 FAQs
* Application of ML algorithms in finance: automation - follow the rules repidly - making judgement calls
    * It is much easier to improve an algorithmic investment process than one replying entirely on humans
* Combining discretionry PMs with ML algorithms may get the best result
* Econometrics is a primary reason that finance has not experienced meaningful progress over the past 70 years
    * Financial ML guides theory, and succeeding in business requires ML
* ML as Black Boxes?
    * People mistrust what they do not understand
    * Human brain is a black box - even neuroscientists still don't know exactly how they work
    * Yang Xi's comment: when people say "ML is black box", it doesn't mean that people don't trust the model developed by Google, while what people doubt about is whether the model is used correctly.
* Backtest Overfitting
    * Arguably the most important open problem in all of mathematical finance
        * There is no precise method to prevent backtest overfitting
        * An investment book that does not address this issue is not worth your time
    * Flexibility of ML makes overfitting a constant threat
    * Shorter datasets, lower signal-to-noise ratio, no laboratories to conduct experiments while controlling all environemental variables
